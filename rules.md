# Rules and scoring
 
I like watching and playing classics. The games are fast and the scores low. I have not finished working on the scoring and keep trying to get it lower.

The scores in the backglass are big and visible from a distance, the current state of the table should be very obvious from a distance as progress changes the whole colour of the table lights.

Exploring the rules and scores is easier in 'Easymode' currently on line 37 of the script. I am very bad at pinball so test a lot in Easymode. Exploring the scoring and objectives without much introduction is supposed to be part of the fun on this table. Watching things light up and working out how to make more things light and increase the scores given.

## Levels/stages

The table has levels each is a colour, to go up a level you have to get your bonus for the current colour full and light all four top lanes the new colour, each level increases the table multiplier.
 
Bonus is limited to one colour above the current level.
 
Each level allows one each of locking and releasing balls to multiball. Light the kickers to allow a lock of that kicker and hit the left top gate to release all locked balls, you cannot lock or release again until you level the table.
 
## Missions/objectives.

The leftmost targets toggle for objective selection right top gate starts the mission to collect the objectives. Objectives are displayed on the score panel using cryptic symbols. Objectives gain scoring bonuses for each locked and free ball on the table as well as table level. Eight sets of objectives per ball and these do not reset on gaining level.

## Combos

Hitting targets from different groups within a short period of time can lead to bonus points in the form of combos. Hitting spinners and kickers at the end of combos increases the bonus.

## Bonus X

One bonus x is available once per level above the first. You must complete all three sets of drop targets in a level to get a bonus x.
